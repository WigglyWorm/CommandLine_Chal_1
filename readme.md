In this challenge, you've been given a zipped file (Pictures.zip) filled with folders of images. Your job is to create a shell script to complete the following:

* Create three folders called: **JPG**, **PNG**, **TIFF**.

* Locate all **.jpg**, **.png**, and **.tiff** files inside the folder and copy each into their respective folder. 

* Create a new file called **PictureCounts.md**.

* Count how many times each file type occurs and log the results to the **PictureCounts.md** file. 

Your final submission should come in the form of: 

* A shell script (**.sh** file) with each of the commands with a comment above. Add a comment above each command describing the action.  

* An annotated PDF document with screenshots of each of the commands being run in the command line and the results shown in the file explorer when relevant.
